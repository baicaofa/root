At <em>keybr.com</em> we have a few fundamental principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>\n<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>\n<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on–going operation of one of our services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>\n<h2>Website Visitors</h2>\n<p>Like most website operators, <em>keybr.com</em> collects non–personally–identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <em>keybr.com</em>’s purpose in collecting non–personally identifying information is to better understand how <em>keybr.com</em>’s visitors use its website. From time to time, <em>keybr.com</em> may release non–personally–identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>\n<p><em>keybr.com</em> also collects potentially personally–identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. <em>keybr.com</em> does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally–identifying information, as described below.</p>\n<h2>Gathering of Personally–Identifying Information</h2>\n<p>Certain visitors to <em>keybr.com</em>’s websites choose to interact with <em>keybr.com</em> in ways that require <em>keybr.com</em> to gather personally–identifying information. The amount and type of information that <em>keybr.com</em> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with <em>keybr.com</em> are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, <em>keybr.com</em> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitors interaction with <em>keybr.com</em>. <em>keybr.com</em> does not disclose personally–identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally–identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website–related activities.</p>\n<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>\n<p><em>keybr.com</em> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, <em>keybr.com</em> may monitor the most popular pages on this site. <em>keybr.com</em> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <em>keybr.com</em> does not disclose personally–identifying information other than as described below.</p>\n<h2>Protection of Certain Personally–Identifying Information</h2>\n<p><em>keybr.com</em> discloses personally–identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on <em>keybr.com</em>’s behalf or to provide services available at <em>keybr.com</em>’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <em>keybr.com</em>’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <em>keybr.com</em> will not rent or sell potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <em>keybr.com</em> discloses potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when <em>keybr.com</em> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <em>keybr.com</em>, third parties or the public at large. <em>keybr.com</em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information.</p>\n<h2>Security of Your Personally–Identifying Information</h2>\n<p>When we collect and process personally–identifying information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>\n<p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.</p>\n<h2>Deleting Your Personally–Identifying Information</h2>\n<p>We only keep your personally–identifying information as long as you have a user account in <em>keybr.com</em>. You can delete your personally–identifying information by deleting an account. To delete your account follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sing-in to your existing account.</li>\n<li>Visit the <code>Account</code> page.</li>\n<li>Click the <code>Delete Account</code> button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note that deleting an account is a permanent operation which cannot be undone.</p>\n<h1>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>\n<p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time.
